# SellText
SellText is an application created as a way to encourage students to save money from buying overpriced textbooks at campus book stores by buying or selling used/new books to other students.

Over the course of 1 year, the average college student spends more than $1,200 on books and materials. Since most college/university programs last 4 years, that's about $5,000 spent on books during an average student's time in college. Keep in mind that students also have to pay for tuition and living expenses.

The problem of overpriced textbooks is not getting any better. As a matter of fact, it is only getting worse! In the past 35 years, textbook costs have skyrocketed 812% and continue to increase as you are reading this very sentence.
